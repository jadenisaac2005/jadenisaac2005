# 👋 Hi, I'm Jaden Isaac

I'm a BTech student (AI & ML) passionate about building intelligent systems and beautiful, scalable web applications. I enjoy working on projects that blend engineering with creativity, especially in AI, web dev, and data science.

## 🧠 AI/ML & Data Projects

- 🔬 [**cpp-neural-network**](https://github.com/jadenisaac2005/cpp-neural-network)  
  A basic feedforward neural network written from scratch in **C++**, with custom activation functions, backpropagation, and dynamic architecture. Great for understanding neural net internals without libraries.

- 👥 [**Customer Segmentation**](https://github.com/jadenisaac2005/Customer-Segmentation-project)  
  Clustering customers using **KMeans** on shopping data to identify behavior-based segments. Includes **EDA**, **visualizations**, and **model evaluation**.

- 🎬 [**Movie Recommendation System**](https://github.com/jadenisaac2005/Movie-Recommendations-System)  
  A hybrid recommendation engine using **content-based filtering** and **collaborative filtering** built in **Python** with **Pandas**, **Sklearn**, and **Cosine Similarity**.

- 📝 [**Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews**](https://github.com/jadenisaac2005/Sentiment-Analysis-of-Movie-Reviews)  
  Natural Language Processing project using **TF-IDF**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Naive Bayes** to classify IMDb reviews as positive or negative.

## 🌐 Web Dev Projects

- 🏦 [**Horizon**](https://github.com/jadenisaac2005/Horizon)  
  A full-stack modern banking platform built with:
  - **Next.js 14**, **React**, **TypeScript**
  - **Appwrite** as backend (auth, DB, storage)
  - **shadcn/ui** for clean component design
  - **Deployed on Vercel**

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

**Languages:** Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C++, SQL  
**Frameworks & Libraries:** React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Sklearn, Pandas, NumPy  
**Tools:** Git, GitHub, Vercel, Appwrite, Jupyter Notebooks
