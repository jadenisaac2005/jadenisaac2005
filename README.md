# Jaden Isaac  
AI Systems Builder | ML + Backend Engineering  

I’m a BTech (AI & ML) student focused on building AI systems with strong engineering foundations.

My work centers on:
- Implementing ML models from first principles  
- Designing clean backend architectures  
- Connecting machine learning with real-world deployment  


## 🚀 Flagship Projects

### Neural Network in C++
A modular feedforward neural network implemented from scratch in C++, featuring backpropagation, custom activation functions, and dynamic layer configuration. Built to understand optimization and learning mechanics at the systems level.
